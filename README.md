## 🆔 **Complaint ID Generation & Tracking**  

### 🔹 **How Complaint IDs Work**
- When a **new complaint is filed**, the system assigns a **unique Complaint ID**.
- Complaint IDs are stored in **Azure Blob Storage** and retrieved when needed.
- Users can **track the status** of their complaint by entering their **Complaint ID**.

### 🔹 **Tracking a Complaint**
1️⃣ **User enters their Complaint ID** in the chatbot.  
2️⃣ **The system searches** the stored complaints in **Azure AI Search**.  
3️⃣ **If found**, the system retrieves the complaint status (e.g., *"In Progress"*, *"Resolved"*, etc.).  
4️⃣ **The chatbot updates the user** on the current status of their grievance.  

---

## 🧩 **How It Works**  

1️⃣ **User enters a complaint** into the chatbot.  
2️⃣ The **chatbot generates a unique Complaint ID** and saves the complaint.  
3️⃣ The **chatbot searches past grievances** using **Azure AI Search**.  
4️⃣ If similar cases exist, they are **retrieved & displayed**.  
5️⃣ The **chatbot generates a response** using **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o**.  
6️⃣ The user receives **both past references & AI-generated solutions**.  
7️⃣ **User can later check their Complaint ID** to track grievance status.

## 📌 **Use Case Example**  

🔹 **User Complaint:** *"The streetlights in my area have been broken for weeks. No action has been taken."*  

🔍 **AI Search Results:**  
- *"Streetlights were repaired in XYZ area after a complaint to the municipal office."*  
- *"Civic authorities resolved a similar issue in ABC colony within 7 days."*  

🆔 **Complaint ID:** *"GRV-20250331-123456"*  

🤖 **AI Response:**  
*"Based on past grievances, you can report this issue to the municipal office under the streetlight maintenance department. Your complaint will be addressed within 7 days."*  

🔎 **Later, when the user checks their complaint status:**  
🆔 **User Enters Complaint ID:** *"GRV-20250331-123456"*  
   **Status Retrieved:** *"Your complaint has been assigned to the municipal office and is currently being reviewed."*

##  **Future Enhancements**  

🔹 **Multilingual Support:** Enable grievance filing in **regional languages**.  
🔹 **Integration with Government APIs:** Automate complaint registration in **official portals**.  
🔹 **Advanced Complaint Status Updates:** Provide **real-time tracking** (e.g., "Pending", "Under Review", "Resolved").  
🔹 **Speech-to-Text:** Users can **speak** their complaints instead of typing.
